				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=17408" title="12:05 am" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">November 25, 2014</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?author=2" title="View all posts by OGR">OGR</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/breakdown.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17420" alt="breakdown" src="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/breakdown-202x300.jpg" width="202" height="300" /></a>When Jeff (Kurt Russell) and Amy Taylor learned they needed to take a long journey across America, they opted for the long way rather than once again flying across some of the spectacular desert vistas and scenic highways. So now in a brand new top of the range SUV with Jeff at the wheel, they feel they are making good time through the heartland.</p>
<p>Then a near miss brought about thanks to the &#8216;they appear that one second you look away from the road&#8217; cliche, and an inopportune broken &#8216;freps&#8217; leaves them in an area suddenly less beautiful and more harsh and unaccommodating.</p>
<p>Rather than leave the nice new expensive car unattended, Amy takes a lift from a friendly trucker, leaving Jeff to wait at the vehicle while they head 5 minutes down the road.</p>
<p>Way more than five minutes later, Jeff heads down the road, befuddled at what could have waylaid his wife. He finds the truckstop and questions one and all about where his wife has gotten to;&#8230; <em><strong>&#8220;What wife?&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>Thankfully this is no mystery whodunit, but a nice little B movie centred around the lengths a desperate man will go to in order to rescue a loved one. In a saga that grows more entertaining as the events become more unlikely, it is the intensity of Kurt Russell that centres the film. Average Guy Jeff takes such drastic measures through Breakdown where so many others would walk away. He cheats death several times, is shot at, and finds himself on both ends of car chases with all manner of vehicles. She must have had the primary credit card&#8230;</p>
<p>The best part of Breakdown is that it doesn&#8217;t seek to outsmart itself with unnecessary complications like <a title="Vacancy (Review)" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=13565" target="_blank">Vacancy </a>and <a title="Midnight Meat Train (Review)" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=6387" target="_blank">Midnight Meat Train</a>, we learn the situation, the protagonists and the stakes early on, and the final hour is spent winning or losing. The last quarter hour is especially pleasing, and when an already decent little B movie ends on a high note, that&#8217;s 90 weekend minutes well spent.</p>
<p><strong>Final Rating &#8211; 7 / 10.</strong> A well made, unassuming 90s thriller that will pleasantly kill a couple hours.</p>

			<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=17120" rel="bookmark">Bird on a Wire (Review)</a></h2>

			<div class="entry-meta">
				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=17120" title="12:14 am" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">November 24, 2014</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?author=2" title="View all posts by OGR">OGR</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
				<div id="attachment_17239" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bird-on-a-Wire.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-17239" alt="Vacant expression actresses' own." src="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bird-on-a-Wire-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Vacant expression actresses&#8217; own.</p></div>
<p>Bird on a Wire relied on the public personas of leads Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn as selling points upon its release in the late 80s. Which is oddly apt I guess, seeing as the film itself is attractive and acceptable only on face value, and is in fact sadly lacking under the shiny visage.</p>
<p>The only thing holding back a major international drug deal is… Rick (Mel Gibson). Why is never explained, especially given Rick is in witness protection and hasn’t been seen for years.</p>
<p>This all changes in one big day for Rick. In his ‘cover’ job as a mechanic at a service station in the middle of nowhere, Rick chances upon Marianne, an ex-girlfriend who is now a powerful and wealthy lawyer. But that’s just the first ‘happening’ on this day, which will see Rick’s cover blown, his boss dead and trained killers on his – and Marianne’s heels.</p>
<p>The modern day equivalent of this film is Knight &amp; Day, a preposterous and sterile action blockbuster with no attention to detail that relies on the high profile leads to drag in the punters. Without Mel and Goldie (or Tom and Cammy) the respective films would vanish without trace.</p>
<p>Mel does his best playing up to previous undercover personas (“Ooooh Girl. He has a pony-tail and was gay! Mmm-mmm…”) and Goldie plays Goldie to the hilt, a sort of likable airhead city girl out of her comfort zone what with all these bullets and the fresh air. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that her every move demands a stunt double;</p>
<p><em><strong>“So Goldie. This next scene has you walking across the lawn to the car…”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“The lawn? Oh NO! This wasn’t in the script. Where is my agent? And my latte and mirror for that matter. ALFONSE THEY’RE DOING IT AGAIN!”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>*Sigh* “Can we have Ms Hawn’s double to set please?”</strong></em></p>
<p>Bird on a Wire has two formerly famous and well liked stars run about in a stunt filled and action packed comedy that offers a bit of everything but ultimately lots of nothing. It is light and fluffy fare for the easily pleased starring a duo Mel and Goldie, now easily forgotten and easily hated respectively.</p>
<p><b>Final Rating – 6.5 / 10.</b> While it has its merits, Bird on a Wire offers little more than superficial and fleeting enjoyment. However if shiny and pleasant distractions are your thing then you could do worse.</p>

			<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=19035" rel="bookmark">Sex Tape (Review)</a></h2>

			<div class="entry-meta">
				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=19035" title="12:06 am" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">November 21, 2014</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?author=2" title="View all posts by OGR">OGR</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sex_tape_ver3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19067" src="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sex_tape_ver3-202x300.jpg" alt="sex_tape_ver3" width="202" height="300" /></a>Jay (Jason Segal) and Anna (Cameron Diaz) are a loving couple with two kids and jobs that everyone seems to have in the movies – he is in the music business (again) and she is a blogger. The love remains, the respect is obvious, but the evil being called Married… with Children has callously murdered their sex life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Free ‘alone time’ is at a premium, and when it becomes available Jay and Anna prefer to spend it on pausing for breath rather than pawing each other breathlessly. They need a spark to liven up the boudoir, and after several doomed attempts they find their muse in the form of a video camera, which leads to a three hour marathon session. (I wasn’t aware that abstaining builds coital credits that can be combined!?! Maybe the first 178 minutes were spent thinking ‘pretend her real name isn’t Cameron. Pretend her real name isn’t Cameron!)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">With the urges sated and a new significant notch on the headboard, Jay and Anna propose to never again let life get in the way of things, then they realise that (current events alert) their hugely personal has been uploaded to the ‘cloud’ and automatically linked to their quasi-mailing list of close friends and family. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">After the obligatory finger pointing and panic, a late night trip to round up all devices that may carry the video seems the only alternative.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Sex Tape wants badly to be an American Pie, Apatow type saucy sex comedy, but like the late thirty something couple in the film it no longer knows how to be dangerous, risky and sexy, so instead it settles for a confusing and bewildering barrage of allegedly naughty behaviors. Drugs are taken, animals beaten, young children swear incessantly, a middle age couple has frenzied back seat sex in a car. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">And all the while the film asks desperately “isn’t this all just kinds of R rated craziness?” before it ends with everyone learning a lesson about what love is. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Segal and Dial are perfectly fine as a couple, and yes they both nude up and join in the debauchery, but the fun seems forced, the raunchiness lacking in an edge and the laughs intermittent at best.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">This is the film equivalent of the drunk single auntie speaking inappropriately at the family gathering, slightly desperate for attention, reaching further for laughs that aren’t there, and only growing louder. You just end up feeling sorry for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"><strong>Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. </strong>As &#8216;dangerous&#8217; as a Miley Cyrus concert.</span></p>

			<div class="entry-meta">
				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=17359" title="12:14 am" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">November 20, 2014</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?author=2" title="View all posts by OGR">OGR</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
				<div id="attachment_17381" style="width: 198px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Curse-of-Chuckles.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17381" alt="No level of your disinterest could hold him..." src="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Curse-of-Chuckles.jpg" width="188" height="269" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">No level of your disinterest could hold him&#8230;</p></div>
<p>So this is the best Chucky film since the first arrival of everyone&#8217;s favourite pint sizes plastic assassin in the mid-80s.</p>
<p>But hold on. <a title="The Chucky / Child’s Play series marathon (Review)" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=9406" target="_blank">Check the decidedly mediocre competition here</a> before you lend much credence to that statement.</p>
<p>Perhaps the cleverest thing that this film does is practically disavow all knowledge of the events of the first six (!) films in the franchise bar some carefully selected moments in the first couple. You can do that when the lead character is a doll. It&#8217;s simply a &#8216;new model&#8217;&#8230; &#8220;Now with no clumsy baggage!&#8221;.</p>
<p>When Chucky arrives in the mail unexpectedly addressed to Nica&#8217;s Mum with no sender details, they look at each other, exchange confused shrugs and plonk the ugly inanimate ginger harlequin on a chair.</p>
<p>Over the next hour or so there are a couple of &#8220;I could have sworn I out the doll here. Now he&#8217;s over there.&#8221; moments, and you might swear that at one point you saw the doll&#8217;s eyes move. Maybe?</p>
<p>Then that night Nica&#8217;s mother falls off the first floor balcony and dies&#8230;</p>
<p>The family arrive within a day or so for the funeral and to wind up the estate. There is concern shown regarding Nica&#8217;s ability to care for herself in this large, remote&#8230; valuable (hint-hint), property. Nica&#8217;s sister is keeping a close eye on the hot nanny, and how her husband looks at her. And the young daughter finds all of this&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Funnily enough the adults all remember the Chucky doll being momentarily sought after in shops, yet no-one recalls the string of murders associated with it.</p>
<p>&#8230;<br />
Let&#8217;s be honest. People watch Chucky for the plot the same way readers peruse Playboy for the articles. This is all about the thrills and kills. This unnecessary edition has few of the first and frankly not many of the latter.</p>
<div id="attachment_17382" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/curse-of-chucky.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-17382" alt="Lindsay Lohan branches out into horror." src="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/curse-of-chucky-300x158.jpg" width="300" height="158" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lindsay Lohan branches out into horror.</p></div>
<p>Chucky looks smoother and cleaner here, and he certainly cracks less of the terrible jokes that proliferated the past few dodgy efforts. In fact it is only in the latter stages that he reverts back to the factory installed hack&#8217;n&#8217;slash settings. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a negative. Curse of Chucky is almost deliberate in pacing, with a new malevolence that the increasingly silly sequels moved away from. While the killings are few, they tend to be a little more gory and effective &#8211; at least as effective as any doll related slaughter can be.</p>
<p>The Chucky films are a confusing throwback to another time. There really isn&#8217;t a need for it in today&#8217;s market. Yet here it is again, whether we like it or not. Chucky is like Hungry-Hungry Hippos; when a kid gets it for Christmas they mutter &#8220;thanks. I guess&#8221; play with a few perfunctory times, then shove it in the top shelf of a cupboard while wondering who actually enjoys these things?</p>
<p>The fact remains that Curse of Chucky is the best film in the series for two decades, mainly because it seeks to replicate all that was competent in the first film. That shouldn&#8217;t for a moment suggest that it merits another one. But I can&#8217;t help but think that at some point in 2015 we&#8217;ll hear <em><strong>&#8216;Revenge of Chucky: Hungry-Hungry Hippos edition&#8217;</strong> </em>is Coming Soon.</p>
<p><strong>Final Rating &#8211; 6.5 / 10.</strong> If ever a toy line earned the right for a merciful discontinuance, it was this one. Cinema&#8217;s stumpiest serial killer continues slashing his way to obsolescence. Please?</p>

<p>When Dalton (Patrick Swayze) was cherry picked to run security at the redneck hook-up and/ or punch-up Double Deuce bar, it was expected that he would bring a little more order and an authority figure. What wasn&#8217;t expected is how many lives he would change for the better.</p>
<p>Each night the reprobates, scumbags, scrags and brawlers circle awkwardly, full of cheap alcohol, unaware that they are being judged. Dalton perches calmly on a stool like a small plastic Jesus on the dashboard, watching on and biding time. Silently making wise choices and being better than you.</p>
<p>Dalton does things his way, and his way works. He imparts his version of the bouncer&#8217;s gospel to the team in the form of redneck calendar quotes and grants the occasional shy smile to the buxom hotties seeking guidance, which he grants only in wise words.</p>
<p>Once all lesser options are exhausted, Dalton &#8211; still quiet and centred &#8211; moves swiftly and decisively into action, bringing peace and harmony to the universe once more with minimal violence and disruption (he never even follows through on his punches) before returning to the stool to recharge his chi through the limitless recuperative powers of self satisfaction.</p>
<p>Away from dedicating his life to non-violence through violence, Dalton sets up his personal retreat dojo in a tranquil rural setting &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t even have a tv! &#8211; performing tai chi and presumably ruminating over the world&#8217;s issues. Often while shirtless&#8230;</p>
<p>Of course Dalton and his sage ways get noticed. The local Donald Trump magnate decides Dalton should either be on his team or elsewhere. The smartest chick in town (Kelly Lynch) &#8211; who fortunately happens to be one of the hottest &#8211; decides she wants Dalton in any position that he opts for. Dalton just sits quietly and bides his time, concentrating on never selling out his principles and friends.</p>
<p>Just as the heat is turned up Sam Elliott arrives with his moustache full of wisdom to act as Dalton&#8217;s personal cowboy-booted Yoda, before a (chakra) balls to the wall finale that includes death by polar bear culminates in quite possibly the dumbest ending sequence ever.</p>
<p>Roadhouse is definitely a member of the &#8216;so bad it&#8217;s good&#8217; club, and the laughs are exclusively of the non-intended variety. It has enough semi-decent moments to not condemn it to D movie hell and a few that find have gained it a cult following, but ultimately it is another 90 minute shrug that most people will forget instantly.</p>
<p>Except for the polar bear kill. That&#8217;s classic for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Final Rating &#8211; 6.5 / 10.</strong> Patrick Swayze&#8217;s other film is just essentially Dirty Dancing for gullible guys.</p>

				<p><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Shocker.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17238" alt="Shocker" src="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Shocker.png" width="189" height="267" /></a>Wes Craven’s career would be nothing without his one big (admittedly genius) idea. By allowing <a title="A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 (Review)" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=6955" target="_blank">Freddie Kreuger free reign in the dreams of teenagers </a>he guaranteed that no killing could be too over the top, no line too lame and no franchise centrepiece too unkillable. After all, there only dream sequences.</p>
<p>If you think about it Last House on the Left is little more than a depressing and all too real tale of mindless killers. The People under the Stairs a gimmicky thing anyone could have made. The Hills have Eyes a generic mutant tale. And don’t get me started on Scream, the ‘anti-franchise’ that played up to ignoring genre clichés at the expense of any semblance of logic.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Shocker, another failed attempt to start a franchise. Where the best bits are a direct rip of his own Elm Street idea, and the worst bits are everything else.</p>
<p>Shocker centre around a young boy named Jonathan and a guy named Pinker. Pinker is a TV repairman ‘slash’ electrician ‘slash’ mass murderer. Jonathan is an innocent young foster child who is somehow able to ‘mind-hack’ Pinker while he carries out every heinous detail of the bloody crimes.</p>
<p>Little Jonny essentially uses these visions to lead the cops to Pinker&#8230; eventually. (After a few goes and some folded flags and 21 gun salutes.)</p>
<p>But even though we might like it to be so. Pinker is a long way from finished. He goes viral after being executed by electrocution. And now things go from mediocre to straight silly. Being an ‘electrician’ I guess gives Pinker extra powers. Now he pops up through TVs, power points and the like in order to continue killing his victims. Which begs the question; what would a serial killer accountant return with? A calculator? A haunted spreadsheet?</p>
<p>Anyway pointless logical conundrums aside, Shocker starts shorting early and gradually loses more and more power as it continues.</p>
<p>As with most Craven efforts, the everyman ‘hero’ is kept deliberately bland in order to make the villain stand out more. But when the villain is as silly as this one and the deaths and chases so very uninventive then the viewer’s battery runs out quick. And it would take much more than a ‘jump’ to respark my interest in Shocker.</p>
<p><strong>Final Rating – 5 / 10.</strong> It would be false to claim this as one of Wes Craven’s lesser efforts. More accurate to say that it just another non-Elm Street effort.</p>

				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=18705" title="12:01 am" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">November 14, 2014</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?author=2" title="View all posts by OGR">OGR</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/locke_ver2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18768" src="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/locke_ver2-202x300.jpg" alt="locke_ver2" width="202" height="300" /></a>Locke is a unique beast. It could be equally effective as a one man stage show. Hell it would work if filmed using just a fixed webcam.</p>
<p>We meet Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) behind the wheel of his car as it heads along a busy freeway, and over the next 90 odd minutes he continues on his drive, and we never leave him until the credits roll. Sure the camera angles change, and we get some nifty looks from outside the car looking in and vice versa, but make no mistake, the next hour and a half is all Locke, all the time.</p>
<p>Locke seems to be driving in a fog – though the air is clear – but he remains coherent and calm through his calls; a never ending stream of calls made to and from his in car hands free.</p>
<p>The initial calls are outward bound cancellations, informing his non-availability for the family night, for the big work job tomorrow &#8211; essentially all those expecting to see Locke in the coming day or two as Locke drives in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Initial befuddlement quickly turns more heated. The construction site where Locke is foreman is scheduled to commence work on one of the biggest and crucial stages in the building of a huge skyscraper, leaving the staff feeling rudderless and angry, and the higher ups exceptionally concerned. More pressing is the home situation, with the kids and wife are expecting dad home to watch the big game over pizza.</p>
<p>Locke deflects the initial wave of curiosity but ultimately he is not a waffler nor a liar – not even when it would make things far easier. Just like his journey, Locke takes a straight line at his interrogators, unlike his journey this does not go at all smoothly.</p>
<p>The truth behind Locke’s motivation is hardly revelatory but doesn’t require me to spoil it. This is a remarkably simple film made with confidence and creativity. Very rarely does a span of more than 60 seconds go by without Locke taking or making a call. Dozens of them in all, with the unseen callers and callees in the double digits.</p>
<p>Through it all Locke stays level headed even as his very world teeters on the brink of collapse. It is a powerful performance by Tom Hardy, playing across from no one and with little more than the hum of his tyres as his accompaniment.</p>
<p>This is a film that will elicit a response of some kind. You’ll either wonder why you like it or know full well just why you hate it. I’m definitely an advocate for creative filmmaking with fresh ideas, and while I’d love to espouse the virtues of Locke from the rooftops, all I can tell you is that I found it original and worth a look. You’ll have to decide if it’s an amazing use – or waste of – your time.</p>
<p><strong>Final Rating – 7 / 10.</strong> The film is like Locke himself; no waffle, no pretensions, no nonsense. Take it or leave it. <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>

			<div class="entry-meta">
				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=17473" title="12:39 am" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">November 13, 2014</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?author=2" title="View all posts by OGR">OGR</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bernie-757146677-large.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17594" alt="Bernie-757146677-large" src="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bernie-757146677-large-202x300.jpg" width="202" height="300" /></a>I would think that the following review should be labelled spoiler filled, although all the info contained below can be found on the DVD cover for the film&#8230;</p>
<p>Bernie (Jack Black) is a small town treasure. A relentlessly cheery 40 something with a big belly full of warm feelings and good intentions. As the local undertaker Bernie is known to everyone in town, and in performing his self described &#8220;service to the deceased&#8221; he had no peer. With his eye for detail and determination to ensure a dignified ceremony for all.</p>
<p>It is at one such event that Bernie encountered Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine), a joyless and perpetually grumpy curmudgeon seemingly destined to die unloved and alone.</p>
<p>And exceedingly wealthy. But Bernie cannot allow this to happen. After early resistance he gradually endears himself to Marjorie, breaking down barriers and forging a tentative alliance that eventually grows into a reliance on Marjorie&#8217;s part. They travel together, Bernie helps with the affairs and generally becomes the right hand man.</p>
<p>People in the town wonder if Bernie is a granny chaser, confusing given that many have already assumed he is gay. Regardless of this the mismatched duo soldier on. Holidays. Lunches. Opera. Bernie organises them all, and initially Marjorie attends with him. But as a leopard cannot change its spots, happiness isn&#8217;t something Marjorie seems accustomed to. Nor comfortable maintaining.</p>
<p>Until one day &#8211; and here&#8217;s the real <strong>SPOILER</strong> part &#8211; Bernie shoots Marjorie four times in the back and plonks the corpse in a freezer&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the story part. The film plays itself as mock doco of sorts, with genuine comments from real locals interspersed with the interpretations of the cast and filmmakers.</p>
<p>Bernie is painted as if he is the nicest killer on earth this side of <em><strong>Slaughter-me Elmo</strong></em>, and Jack Black&#8217;s effervescent performance certainly does endear him to all. In fact upon hearing of his charges the community banded together to vow that no jury would find him guilty, to the point where the trial was moved to another state.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my problem. While the film seems to take some liberties and make some assumptions as to the events around Marjorie&#8217;s death, it does not pretend that Bernie didn&#8217;t admit to culpability. What it does do is portray it like he had no other option&#8230; No option but to shoot an elderly woman in the back. Four times. Then hide the body and spend the better part of a year covering up the truth. While spending the old lady&#8217;s money freely and liberally.</p>
<p>The film even pains district attorney Danny Buck (Mathew McConaughey) as a villain due to his efforts to have Bernie found guilty.</p>
<p>Now as far as I could see Bernie had plenty options; discontinue any relationship with Marjorie once her settings switched back to &#8216;bitch mode&#8217;. Surely the were dozens of elderly women that he could befriend and help? And if the badgering and belittling grew too tiresome;</p>
<p><strong>1/</strong> stop spending her money<br />
<strong>2/</strong> lay down the law and threaten to leave<br />
<strong>3/</strong> leave<br />
<strong>4/</strong> at least don&#8217;t shoot an elderly woman in the back four times and cover up your murder.</p>
<p>Look play it how you like. Some people are aggravating and hard to live with. Some people are depressing to be around, especially for someone so effortlessly cheery. I fail to see how this somehow justifies their death, and a film that takes great pains to cinematically exonerate such an action. I can see with only a few subtle tweaks how Bernie could come across as an opportunistic greedy man hiding behind a friendly facade, out to get an old woman&#8217;s money.</p>
<p>Bernie might be the nicest murderer currently imprisoned. But that makes him no less a murderer, even if this film strives to rewrite moral history on his behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Final Rating &#8211; 7 / 10.</strong> An interesting &#8211; if flawed conceit &#8211; and Jack Black&#8217;s best performance since <a title="High Fidelity (Review)" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=3269" target="_blank">High Fidelity</a> make it interesting. They don&#8217;t make it right. Proving Bernie isn&#8217;t in the same league as Charles Manson doesn&#8217;t automatically make him Ghandi&#8230; or Oprah.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Memories-of-murder.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17960" alt="Memories of murder" src="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Memories-of-murder-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a>When the discovery of the body of one young girl leads to the discovery of another young girl&#8217;s body, local police are suddenly and rudely made aware that this might be more than an isolated incident removed with paperwork. Though well meaning, cops in sleepy locales often aren&#8217;t prepared for such cases and the early efforts are often stymied by amateur stuff. Keenness isn&#8217;t necessarily a synonym for competence.</p>
<p>Enter the experienced &#8216;guy from the city&#8217;. A quiet man with an eye for detail, he instantly develops leads and theories, much to the chagrin of the earnest locals who mistakenly assumed they were the men for the job.</p>
<p>The search is lengthy and often leads to dead ends and occasional and tantalising near misses. There are chase scenes, breakthroughs and let downs. Thankfully there are equally no wise cracking sidekicks, no savant style geniuses or people with the ability to see the future. This might harm the Wow factor, but adds to the authenticity of the film. Something that was obviously a primary aim of the director, who went on to make the pretty good <a title="The Host (Review)" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=2667" target="_blank">The Host</a> and the overrated <a title="Madeo (Mother) (Review)" href="http://oneguyrambling.com/?p=5846" target="_blank">Mother</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently based upon a real life series of unsolved murders in South Korea, Memories of Murder is a tantalising Zodiac style police procedural, with the point of difference being that in real life police investigations aren&#8217;t helmed by charismatic over actors with the ability to see the one vital clue regardless of circumstances, and that cases aren&#8217;t busted within 42 minutes, with the culprit always some guy or gal that they questioned earlier.</p>
<p>No in this case the truth is far more carefully secreted and not able to be uncovered after a rapid fire verbal exchange or a random clue appearing at the right time.</p>
<p><strong>Final Rating &#8211; 6.5 / 10.</strong> Here is a film that ignores the thrill of the chase in favour of the authenticity and frustration of the tedious procedure. It is well made and often compelling, but not necessarily what you might expect going in.</p>

				<p><a href="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/juice.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17286" alt="juice" src="http://oneguyrambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/juice-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a>Juice would not exist without Tupac. That&#8217;s not to say that it would not have been made sometime in the early 90s. It just would not have been remembered.</p>
<p>Even that memory is more about Tupac the deceased rapper than charismatic and talented actor. Here he plays one of four typical urban youths, obsessed with music, computer games, hollerin&#8217; at girls and skipping school.</p>
<p>These young men might blur the lines of legality with some shoplifting and stepping nose to nose to a rival Hispanic gang, but for the most part they are boys being boys and finding their way in life.</p>
<p>Then Bishop (Tupac) decides that they need more &#8216;juice&#8217;, more renown and greater standing in the neighbourhood as being hard. When he arrives holding a gun with a head full of ideas about how to raise their standing, his longtime friends all understandably have mixed emotions, especially from aspiring DJ &#8216;Q&#8217; who happens to have his big showcase that very night, a night that could make or break his career.</p>
<p>The film starts out as an energetic character study, full of good tunes (the opening credits feature Eric B &amp; Rakim) and hijinks. It quickly turns into a Boyz n the Hood lite effort, as Bishop&#8217;s mind state and attitude set him on a crash course with hard earned morals.</p>
<p>This abrupt change is a little disconcerting, especially when there aren&#8217;t too many decent character studies featuring young black males that don&#8217;t culminate in crime and tragedy. Why you would start mildly innovative and settle for same old I don&#8217;t know, what I so know is that the are 27 other young urban crim stories like Juice from the 90s, this settles somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>Final Rating &#8211; 6.5 / 10.</strong> In the pursuit of respect and power, Juice loses just a little of both.</p>
